## Description

"Climate Crusaders" aims to educate elementary school students to high schools students about the rising global mean sea level. In our game written in PyGame and Python, you play as a grab trying to escape the ever growing sea level which is meant to symbolize the ever growing difficulty of organisms to survive in the face of climate change. The game is meant to be a fun and interactive way to teach students about the effects of climate change and how it affects the world around them.
